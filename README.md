# Crafty Burgers

The Crafty Burgers application is a burger ordering system, that includes a UI for the customer and the kitchen staff. 
A suitable UI-design was derived from user studies and implemented with Vue.js and Node.js.

The ordering system for burgers, is intended to be used on monitors in the restaurants of Crafty Burger, but also on mobile phones to make orders on the way to the restaurants. The customer can preview their own individual burger and can filter the ingredients according to their food preferences. 

There is also a  kitchen view for the employees of the restaurant. They just need to login to start their shift and click next when a burger is completed. They can also see which ingredients are out of stock. So that the responsible employee can refill them.
